# apriori test category data


# Support: (transactions that include X) / (all transactions)
# supp(xUy) = union of item lists X and Y. == P(Ex âˆ© Ey) = probability of X and Y appearing together.
# e.g. 4 of 7 rows contain L1. support = 4/7. (.57)
# e.g. 4 of 7 rows contain Lamar. support = 4/7 (.57)
# e.g. 3 of 7 rows contain L1 AND Lamar. support = 3/7 (.42)


# Confidence: supp(xUy) / supp(x). AKA P(Y|X) "the probability of Y occurring, given X has occurred AKA The Conditional prob of Y.
# e.g. 4 of 7 rows contain Lamar. support = 4/7 (.57). confidence is .57 (same as support)
# e.g. 4 rows contain L1, and 3 of those contain Lamar. L1 => Lamar is .75 confidence
# e.g. 4 rows contain L1, and 1 of those contain Scanner. L1 => Scanner is .25 confidence
# e.g. 3 rows contain L1 & Printer. 2 of those also contain Lamar. L1+Printer => Lamar is .66 confidence
# e.g. 3 rows contain Printer, and all 3 contain L1. Printer => L1 is 1 confidence (100%)
# L1 => Printer is .75 confidence
# Printer => L1 is 1.0 confidence 


# Lift: confidence / supp(Y)
# e.g. L1 => Lamar might happen 75% of the time, but how muchg does Lamar happen anyways? More or less than when L1 happens?

# support: % of rows (transactions) w/ lhs => rhs relationship (the association))
# proportion of rows with the entire transaction (both sides)
# e.g. L1 is 4/7 of rows (transactions) (.57), but L1 => Lamar is 3/7 (.42)

# confidence: % of transactions w/ LHS+RHS (association) over just LHS. "this pair appears together instead of separate this % of time"
# P(XUY)
# "if I see lhs, this percent of time I will also see rhs" 
# note: RHS could just appear a lot with other stuff - confidence gives no indication of that. Not necessarily the cause, just the reliability.
# for single elements support = confidence
# e.g. printer is in 3/7 rows, L1 is 4/7 rows, and 3/4 of rows w/ L1 also have printer
# L1 => printer should be 


# e.g. scanner is in 3/7 rows, L1 is 4/7 rows, and 1/4 of rows that have L1, also have scanner.
